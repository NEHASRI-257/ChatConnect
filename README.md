As part of this task, I independently developed a real-time messaging web application named **ChatConnect**. This project was built from scratch using modern full-stack technologies, with a focus on real-time communication, clean design, and cross-device responsiveness.

###  Objective  
The primary goal was to create a responsive chat platform where multiple users can join a common chat room and exchange messages instantly. The application had to be fully functional, visually appealing, and deployable to the web.

###  Development Process  

#### Frontend Development  
I built the frontend using **React.js**, focusing on creating a user-friendly and minimal interface. The UI was styled using **custom CSS** to ensure originality and avoid reliance on frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap. Key frontend components include:
- A join screen with inputs for name, avatar, country, and status  
- A responsive chat window with message display, input box, and send button  
- A top navigation bar showing user info and logout option  

#### Backend Development  
The backend was developed using **Node.js** with the **Express.js** framework. I implemented **Socket.IO** to enable real-time, bi-directional communication between users. The backend handles:
- User connection and disconnection events  
- Broadcasting messages to all connected clients  
- Managing user sessions within a shared chat room  

#### WebSocket Integration  
Using **Socket.IO** on both client and server, I established persistent socket connections for instant message exchange. Messages are broadcast in real time, and the chat interface updates dynamically without requiring page reloads.

#### Deployment  
- The **frontend** was deployed using **Vercel**, enabling fast global delivery.  
- The **backend** was hosted on **Render**, providing a scalable and cloud-based API.  
Environment variables were properly configured to connect the frontend to the backend seamlessly.

#### Testing & Debugging  
I performed end-to-end testing to ensure stable performance across devices. Key tests included:
- Message delivery timing  
- Handling multiple users simultaneously  
- Input validations  
- UI responsiveness and compatibility across devices
